Tree is one of the most important elements of our environment. It is impossible to think any environment without tree. So tree plantation is a burning question in deed. We know that trees supply us with oxygen and receive carbon dioxide. We cannot live without oxygen. The food what we eat to live, the medicine what we take to cure diseases, the furniture what we use for comfort, the dress what we wear to look us good, the cars and vehicles what we use to run our life smooth tree is a must. That is why it is very essential for us to consider tree plantation. Actually planting tree according to the need and necessity of the environment is called tree plantation. We know that to keep balance of the environment 25% of a country should be wood area. But actually many countries of the world do not have this quantity of wood area. In Bangladesh we have only 6% forest area of total land. It is not at all desirable to us. So realizing the need and necessity we should be aware of tree plantation. In the tree plantation week from July 1 to 7 we all should plant at least one piece of tree. We can plant tree in the open space of our houses, fields and by the side of the roads. In order to ensure a healthy environment we should stop deforestation and provide tree plantation. If we can keep balance of the environment we will live better. So we all should come forward to prevalent tree plantation.
