Tree plantation means planting trees more and more. Trees are part and parcel of our environment. Trees are useful to us in many ways. They give us foods, fruits, medicines, woods, flowers, shades etc. They also give us oxygen and take in carbon dioxide. They keep the balance of the environment. They protect us from various kinds of natural calamities like floods, droughts, storms, cyclones etc. But people cut down trees and endanger our own lives. Cutting down trees causes serious damage to the soil. It also causes global warming which may bring about a serious cause of sufferings to the human beings in the near future. Trees are our best friends. So, we should not cut and use trees at random. Rather we should plant more trees for a healthier, happier and better life.
