Tree plantation means to plant as much as planting a tree in a planning way is called tree plantation. It is the part and parcel of our life and also for the environment. Without the tree, we can’t imagine our life. But day by day the increasing rate of population trees is damage. More people need more food, more shelter, and more things. To meet up their demand trees are cut down. Trees play a vital role in the ecological balance. Without tress, cause natural hazards, drought, soil erosion, global warming, and many other bad things. From trees, we get a lot of things. We take oxygen which is gifted from trees. Furniture, wood, medicine, shade, air, etc. are the gifted item from trees.

To keep the earth calm and peaceful need to keep our world under forestation. A country needs at least 25% forest area of its total land area. If we are not aware of this our future generation will suffer from environmental pollution. Also may appear different type of diseases. We use our fallow area for deforestation. Such as our homestead, the two sides of roads and railways, unfertilized area, etc. Both govt. and common people should take proper steps to increase the tree plantation rate. So, plant more trees and save the world.
