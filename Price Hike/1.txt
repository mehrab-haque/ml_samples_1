Price-hike means an unusual increase in the prices of daily necessaries. Nowadays, it is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh and the problem is getting worse day by day. The market syndicate is mostly responsible for this price-hike in Bangladesh. Besides, some dishonest traders create an artificial crisis by storing essential commodities with a view to making huge profits. Other factors that cause price-hike are less agricultural production due to natural disasters, lack of raw-materials, want of speedy communication, political instabilities, money inflation at the national level, etc. Price-hike causes unrest in society. Lives of common people are under a great threat. Prices of essential’ commodities go beyond the capacity of the poor and the fixed income people. More or less, most people suffer from the problem of price-hike. It is a problem that cannot be solved overnight. The Government should take both immediate and long-term steps to reduce price-hike. Any syndicates of the businessmen are to be suppressed boldly and inflation of money should be controlled. The agricultural sector should be given priority in the annual budget. At the same time, public awareness should also be raised against price-hike.
