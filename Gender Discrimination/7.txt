Gender discrimination is the difference between male and female in respect of enjoying human rights. It is severe in Bangladesh where it starts at birth. Female children, girls, women and destitute old women are the worst sufferers. There are many causes behind it. Social prejudices, customs, religious misinterpretation and social structure are main cases of gender discrimination. Parents consider female children as burden and try to get rid of them as early as possible. They think that the male can contribute more to the family. So, they taka care in all respect for the male children. The effects of gender discrimination are many. It has some long-term negative effects on the body and mind of the girls and women in family.
