A moonlit night looks like a lake of silver. In the day the world is a lake of gold. The dazzling light of the sun gives way to the soft light of the moon at night. The moon exercises a peculiar fascination on our hearts and heads. The entire outlook of man undergoes a transformation.

Hi the villages the moonlight has a particular attraction. During summer you cannot enjoy a village walk under the burning sun. At night you cannot walk since it is dark. But a moonlit night is a wonderful time to move out and enjoy nature in its purity.

During such a night my friend and I used to walk from one end of our village to the other end. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We started at sunset and walked off to a place some six or seven miles away. Not only did we reach the other place thoroughly refreshed, but acquired a poetic uneasiness to make couplets.
