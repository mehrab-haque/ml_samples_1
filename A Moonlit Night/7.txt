 A moonlit night is a remarkable occasion for a beauty-seeker who has an aesthetic thirst for poetic feeling. In a moonlit night, nature looks as though it were a dreamland full of life but painted on a colored canvas. Things,' as

 
a whole, seem to be a living poem harmoniously unifying a huge variety of subjects. The moon, as it drifts along in the sky, darts its romantic look at the earth, tinging it with a vivacious glow of spiced color. The night is calm. Seen from a high place, the flora together with the edging waterline or river, look as if they were resting peacefully. All this catches the imagination; that is why it arouses some imagination. Imagination, as we know, is thought dominated by feeling, with a flavor of intoxication. A moonlit night has all the quality to arouse such solemn intoxication in the mind. The deemly glowing pieces of flocculent

 
clouds fixed to the ceiling of the sky snatches the mind away. Such a night is worth enjoying foregoing the opportunity of sleep.
