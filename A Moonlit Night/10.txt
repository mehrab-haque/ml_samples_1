A moonlit night in which the full noon shines in its entire glory in the sky is called a moonlit night. It is really a night of dream and enjoyment. In the autumn the sky remains cloudless and the moon looks like a big silver disc in the sky. The silvery light of the moon floods the earth and the sky. The moon’s rays reflecting on seas, rivers, ponds and hills create a music spell. When the moon pours her light on the waves of water, it sparkles like a diamond. The smooth rays of the moon please our eyes and mind. The natural beauty of a moonlit night can better be realized than described. People feel great joy. Children play and run about. Men and women go from one house to another. Women can make their babies sleep singing the songs of stars and moon. Lower animals take the moonlit for day and start roaming about. It seems that the whole nature has taken a new form and everywhere is bright, bright and bright. A moonlit night spreads a feeling of joy in all objects of nature. In addition, we forget our animosity with others. We make a congregation and chat in different subjects with others. The moonlit night reminds us the mystery of creation of Allah. We can evaluate the moonlit night as offering a charming sight to all living beings.
