A moon-lit night is a remarkable occasion for a beauty seeker. It offers a very charming view. It is just a thing of beauty and joy. In a moonlit night, the moon looks like a disk of silver. The moon bathes the world with her silvery light. The sparkling stars twinkle around the moon. Rivers, ocean, canals and ponds seem to laugh in the splendid moonlit night. The trees and creepers look bright and sparkling. The flowers glitter in the garden like pearls. People of all ages amuse among themselves in moon-lit night. They pass some hours in gossiping. It has a magical power of transporting us to a land of fairy and imagination. It arouses the ports of all languages to sing highly of a moonlit night. It loses the dullness of a night and thrills our heart.
