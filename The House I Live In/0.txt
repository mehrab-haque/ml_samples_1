I along with my family live in a two storeyed modern building in Dhaka. It is in the 1st floor. It stands on the river Buriganga. It faces the south, So the sunshine and fresh air can easily enter into it. It has three bedrooms, one drawing room, one dining room and a kitchen. All the bedrooms have attached bathroom cum toilet. The kitchen stands on the north. Our house is provided with modern facilities including water supply, electricity and gas. Since my house is in the suburb , it is free from all kinds of pollution and terrorism .

My home is adorned with nature. There is green everywhere around my home. My little home is replete with green trees. There is a flower garden in the courtyard . So sweet scent spreads all over the house. There is an arsenic free tube-well near the main gate. The house is free from the unexpected disturbance of naughty children and animals, because it is surrounded by a boundary wall. There is also a calling bell in front of the main gate. We let any stranger enter the house after knowing his identity . I do not face any problem to live here. I am really happy living in such a good house.
