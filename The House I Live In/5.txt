The place where I live with my family is my home. It is a village college called Rajanpur, Upazilla Nabinagar in B.Baria district. The main house is mainly made of bricks. It is a big house with wide windows on all sides and doors on two sides. There are two bedrooms, one sitting room, and one dining room. Each and every one of the room is well-furnished and spotlessly neat and clean. It is well ventilated. Sufficient air and light can get into it. The home is surrounded by green trees on three sides. It has an ample yard. The home is very beautiful to look at. A lovely flower garden is in front of the gate fo the house. So, the home is very comfortable to live in. I have a separate reading room in it. I use it as my bedroom too. I like my home very much because it is an ideal house to live in peace.
