 True education is a must for any kind of development of a nation. But it is very shocking that the students are adopting unfair-means in the examination in the recent years, I oppose this social evil strictly . I am against this curse because the harmful effects of copying in future life beggar description . Copying or unfair-means in the examination creates a non-skilled manpower, increases unemployment and corruption in the society. It deteriorates the standard of education.

There are many reasons behind unfair-means examination. The lack of facilities in our educational institutions is the main among them. we have too little educational institutions in comparison to the number of students to provide standard education. Besides, most of the teachers are indifferent in taking classes. Often they do not possess proper training. The existing examination system its contributes to it. To prevent unfair means in the examination the authorities concerned have taken some effective measures. They have increased facilities for the students and teachers. They have established a curriculum suitable for the age and have made the examination system modern. To adopt unfair-means in the examination is a punishable crime nowadays. I think these preventive measures will refrain the students from adopting unfair means in the examination.
