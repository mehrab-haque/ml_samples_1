Unfair means in the examination means copying in the examination. It is an evil practice and it degrades the moral values of students. I do not support unfair means in the examination. Not only I but also others are against of it. The students who pass any examination by adopting unfair means in the examination do not get any good job and cannot serve the nation. A dishonest man like him is the burden of the society. That is why I am against of it. There are some reasons of adopting unfair means in the examination that are the negligence of the administration, the opportunity of copying in the examination hall, student politics, and unconsciousness of guardians, the dishonesty of some teachers, defective education and examination system etc. Moreover, some students do not prepare their lessons. They waste their valuable time in gossiping, roaming, playing, travelling. As a result, they are compelled to adopt unfair means in the examination. Recently the authorities have taken some effective measures to prevent unfair means in the examination. The whole system of examination has changed. The measurement of punishment against the offenders has also been increased. The good effects of the preventive measures are that the consciousness of the authorities, teachers, students, and guardians has been increased.
