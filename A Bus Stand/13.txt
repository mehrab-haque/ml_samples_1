A bus stand is a place where service buses stop and start from. After a fixed time a good number of up and down buses touch at a bus stand at different hours of the day and night.


 
In cities there are sheds for passengers at a bus stand. It is a temporary shelter for passengers. Passengers wait for sometime to get on a bus. In some bus stands there are counters for ticket. Passengers stand in a line for buying tickets. Sometimes there is exchange of hot words if anybody breaks the line.

A bus stand is a busy place. One bus comes and another starts for. The passengers coming here have no time to talk or to look at others. When a bus comes or starts for, passengers become busy in procuring a seat. They push one another to get into it.

Ladies find it too difficult to get on a bus. The drivers and the conductors are also very busy. Their shouts are heard. They try to get as many passengers as they can.


 
Generally a bus is always jam packed and it is more jam packed during office hours. So very few people can get into it. A bus stand is always noisy.

There are road-side tea stalls, small shops, hawkers selling betel leaf and cigarette at a bus stand. Magazines and seasonal fruits are also sold here. It is a useful place indeed.
