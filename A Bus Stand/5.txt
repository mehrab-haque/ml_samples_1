Some bus stops have sheds to give shelter for the passengers. But some are without sheds. In big bus stops the serial of buses is maintained for starting. There are ticket counters in some important bus stands. Maximum bus stops have no sanitation facilities. Very few bus stops have this facilities. There are tea stalls, confectioneries, cigarette and betel leaf stalls, book-stalls in some bus stands. The place of a bus stand remains crowded almost all hours of the day. When the buses stop or start, the conductors and helpers shout to get on buses and get down buses. A bus stand is always busy for movement. None stays long time there. It is public gathering place.
