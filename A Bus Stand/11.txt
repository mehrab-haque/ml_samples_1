A bus station is a very important place to those who travel by bus from one place to another. It is a place where buses stop for sometime to facilitate the passengers to get in and to get down from them. Important bus stands, especially the bus stands in a city or, towns remain crowded throughout the day. Passengers are always found waiting there. When a bus stops at such a stand, there is an unusual bustle and hurry among the passengers. Some passengers hurry to get down from the bus, while passengers waiting for the bus want to get into it. As a result there is a great collision among the passengers. In such a situation the old and the weak find it difficult to get into or get down. The scene often goes so far that it seems passengers are fighting with one another to get in or to get down first. Taking advantage of this pickpockets sometimes pick the pockets of the passengers. Moreover, shouts of coolies, conductors, bus-helpers make the place noisier. These are the usual sights of a bus stand during the busy hours of the day. Besides, hawkers are often found busy selling their goods like cigarettes, betel-leaves, newspaper, fruits etc.
