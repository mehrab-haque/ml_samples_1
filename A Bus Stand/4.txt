A bus stand is a crowded place where buses stand and state from. The people gather there and wait impatiently for a bus to come. When a bus comes from a long distance the station becomes very busy. Passengers get into and get down from the buses. Shouts of the helpers and conductors are heard continuously. At some bus stands do not have sheds. The passengers have to wait in the burning sun or in the rain there. In some bus stands there are ticket counters. Passengers stand in a long line to buy tickets. There are small shops at a bus stand. In some bus stands there are book stalls and restaurants. The hawkers sell betel leaf, bread, cigarettes etc. Sometimes seasonal fruits are also sold in a bus stand. After all, a bus stand plays an important role in communication. So Government should take proper steps for the improvement of a bus stand.
