Food is an essential thing to lie on this earth. Humankind cannot survive without food. But, food adulteration has become a serious issue today. Vegetables, fruits, oil, fishes, milk products and baby foods- all these are being adulterated every day. Food adulteration means adding substance to a food-item to increase its quantity instead of quality. Generally, the adulterant addition is done intentionally. The major cause behind food adulteration is the ultimate greed of dishonest and immoral businessmen. They prefer their business profit to human life. Surveys show that maximum foods are dangerously adulterated. For example, the owners of food and beverage industries apply deadly chemicals that contain poisonous substances. These contaminated foods contain destructive substances such as Aldrin, DDT, Chlordane, Formalin, etc. which are very damaging to our health as well as our life. Even they can lead us to death. Many life-taking diseases like kidney failure, liver damage, cancer, heart diseases, etc can attack us for taking adulterated foods. Another report shows that taking adulterated foods also cause dysentery and diarrhea. It is time to stop this serious issue. Nowadays the government, as well as the general public, is very much aware of this critical problem. In order to detect and punish the dishonest businessmen, the government has arranged for mobile courts. To eradicate this national problem both the government and the public should work together. This is a kind of social crime. At any cost, food adulteration needs to be removed from our society.
