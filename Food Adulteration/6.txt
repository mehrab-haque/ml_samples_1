Man cannot live without food. It is essential for health and life. But this food must be pure, clean and fresh. Nowadays, foods are often adulterated. In hotels and restaurants stale and rotten foods are mixed with fresh food and served to the customers. Fish and vegetables are adulterated by putting on them chemicals and other preservatives in order to make them look fresh. Bakery and confectionery products are also adulterated by using toxic substances. Junk food contains harmful chemicals. Even fruits, milk and beverages are also adulterated . In fact, all kinds of foods and food articles are adulterated by dishonest and greedy businessmen for a quick and unearned profit. Adulterated foods are a serious health hazard. They cause many fatal diseases and even death. Food adulteration has become an alarming problem in our country. Dealing in adulterated food is a great crime. The criminals have to be identified and punished. We must remember that if we fail to solve it at once, this problem may go out of control in near future. However, though our government  has taken some steps to remove food adulteration, but these are not sufficient at all. In the end, it is not possible for the government to solve food adulteration problem in single hand. Public awareness should be created so that people can become careful about buying foods and food articles.
