Deforestation means cutting and burning down forests at random. It is a threat to our environment. Deforestation is now a global problem as many countries are destroying their forest land for cultivation and living.

There are many reasons for the cutting down of forests. Only men are responsible. Firstly the increase of population is the main reason for that. As the population is increasing day by day, we require more habitation places and cultivable lands for this additional population. So, People cut trees to make houses and destroy forests for cultivation. Secondly, we need more roads, bridges, educational institutions, hospitals, etc. As a result, trees are being destroyed. Thirdly, we cut trees to get timber and wood for making beautiful furniture and house. Besides, cooking food, making fires, melting pitch are also responsible for cutting trees.


 
There are many bad impacts of deforestation on the environment. Deforestation causes an increase in carbon dioxide and global warming. Then global warming causes ecological imbalance and brings about various natural calamities like floods, cyclones, tidal surge, sea-level rise, etc.  All these terribly affect wildlife. Deforestation is the main culprit for global warming, climate change, and ecological imbalance.

To save our environment, we must stop cutting trees and plant more trees. The government should increase public awareness among people.
