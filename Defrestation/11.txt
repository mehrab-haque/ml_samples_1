Deforestation or indiscriminate cutting of trees has become a global problem in recent times. Deforestation refers to the destruction of forests at random. It is just the reverse of tree plantation. The most common causes of deforestation are cutting down trees and burning rain-forests. World’s population is increasing constantly. This increasing population requires more amount of land for habitations and cultivation purposes. They also need timber, wood, fuel, and furniture. So, people cut down trees in order to meet these requirements. Sometimes, forests are occupied in the name of development. Moreover, a number of dishonest people cut down trees in our forest for money. Deforestation has many adverse effects on our life and environment. The removal of trees causes the birds and other animals, living on them, to leave the place. It also causes serious damage to the soil, as trees give protection to soil as well. Due to deforestation the amount of carbon dioxide is increasing worldwide. As a result, the world is getting warmer. Most importantly, deforestation is mostly responsible for climate change, which results in rising of temperature, erratic rainfall, floods, cyclones, drought, melting of polar ice-caps etc. It hampers our agricultural production as well. In order to save our existence, deforestation must be tackled. For this common people should be made aware of the causes and consequences of deforestation. Alternative use of trees should be found out. Government should introduce strict laws in order to protect our forests. By preventing deforestation, we can endure a better environment for us.
