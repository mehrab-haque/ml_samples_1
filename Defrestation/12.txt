eforestation is the result of clearing green forests for various purposes. There are various countries, like Honduras, Nigeria, Philippines, Benin, Ghana, Nepal, North Korea, etc, facing deforestation issues. The only planet is earth having life, if we cross the limits we have to face various problems like global warming, ozone depletion, air pollution and many more. So, awareness campaigns are must for the reduction in cutting down of trees.

Chipko Movement: One of the Indian forest conservation movements was started in the 1970s popularly known as the “Chipko Movement” or “Chipko Andolan”. A group of women in Uttarkhand protected trees by making a circle around it and hugged the trunk. There are several preventive measures taken by the Indian government also. One of that is the “Forest Act of India, 1927”, specially made for the preservation of forests.

Various NGOs all around the world are working for the prevention of greenery on the earth. It is prohibited to build industrial setup by clearing the forest. Forests are the source of life for living beings. Cutting down forests is not beneficial for the ecosystem by any means.

The growing population is the root cause of deforestation. The population needs space to rehabilitate. Even, live stocks are not getting space for grazing.

Future of the Greenery

In a survey, it is found that in the coming days, the earth will lose half of the total greenery. This survey also said that population is the root cause of any degradation of natural elements. The loss of deforestation can be recovered only if the number of trees will be planted.
